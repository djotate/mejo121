<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Dylan "Dilly-Jo" Tate, and I am a student in the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am a gaming and esports journalist with a love for Nintendo video games, including Super Smash Bros., Pokémon, and many more. Currently, I write news stories for <a href="https://www.dailyesports.gg/author/dylantate/">Daily Esports</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendoenthusiast.com/author/dylantate/">Nintendo Enthusiast</a>. You can check out my full portfolio <a href="https://dylantate.journoportfolio.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I have been published by many websites since I first began covering esports news in 2016. Here are a few of them:</p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not only do I report on competitive Smash Bros., but I also compete in it! I am currently ranked No. 10 in Chapel Hill, NC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</li>
  <li>I love a cappella music, and am a bass singer myself. During my senior year of high school, I sang in my school's a cappella group, BCA RoyalKeys, and we recorded two songs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMXoRmEe7RI">Brother</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gzEG7zKkQ">Wayfaring Stranger</a>.</li>
  <li>During the summer, I volunteer with a Christian missions organization in Alamance County, NC called Christian Adventurers. Over the past 13 years, I have gone on 22 mission trips with Christian Adventurers.</li>
</ul>
